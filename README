		GJDB Version 6


DESCRIPTION
-----------

This directory contains GJDB, a GDB-like modification (and partial
bug fixing) of Sun's jdb, for use with Sun's JDK 1.3, or JDK 1.2.x + JDI 1.0.

GJDB differs from jdb in that 

(1) Some broken features now work,

(2) It is possible to send System.in input to the debugged program.  GJDB
    passes input from the terminal to your program when the program is
    not stopped.

(3) The commands have been made GDB-like and there is an Elisp file defining
    a gjdb command (analogous to gdb) for Emacs.

Unlike gjdb version 1, this JDI-based version can compute a large and useful
subset of the Java expression language.  For example

	(gjdb) print x + 1

or 

	(gjdb) print x.f ()

At the moment, proper documentation is missing.  Type 'help' in the debugger.

INSTALLATION
------------

To configure, use

	DIR/configure OPTIONS

in the directory in which you want to build, where DIR designates the 
directory in which you have unpacked the source (can be .).  Use

	DIR/configure --help

to see the options.

Next, you can simply type

	make

to build,

	make install

to install, and 

	make install-doc

to compile and install the documentation file gjdb.pdf.

To use gjdb from Emacs, arrange to load it in your initialization
(.emacs) file with the command

	(load "DIR/gjdb")
	
where DIR is the directory in which 'make install' put gjdb.el (see the 
output of configure --help), or just

	(load "gjdb")

if you have put DIR on Emacs's load path.
